# diffusion-nonlinear-control

1. The notebook 'diffusion_nonlinearcontrol' contains a tutorial to learn a feedback controller using diffusion models for different types of nonlinear systems.
2. Notebook 'diffusion_control-wObstacles' implements the denoising diffusion-based nonlinear control algorithm to learn a feedback controller with obstacles in the domain.
3. Lastly, 'bullet_implementation' imports the learnt control from 1. or 2. to a PyBullet environment to implement on a robot of your choice. The notebook currently contains an example of the Husky robot using the controller learned using unicycle dynamics.
