# diffusion-nonlinear-control
This repository is contains code for the paper Denoising Diffusion Based Feedback Control of Nonlinear Systems.

1. The notebook 'diffusion_nonlinearcontrol' contains the tutorial to learn a feedback controller using diffusion models for different types of nonlinear systems.
2. Notebook 'diffusion_control-wObstacles' contains a tutorial to learn a feedback controller with obstacles in the domain.
3. Lastly, 'diffusion_implementation' imports the learnt control from 1. or 2. a PyBullet environment to implement on a robot of your choice. The notebook currently contains an example for the Husky robot using the contoller learnt using unicycle dynamics.
